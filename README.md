## Project Overview 📊

The Around PT Web Project is a responsive front-end website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project presents content related to travel, places, or services within the “Around PT” concept and was developed to strengthen core front-end skills, including layout structure, responsive design, DOM manipulation, and basic interactivity using vanilla JavaScript, without relying on frameworks.

This project demonstrates the ability to combine structure, styling, and behavior in a clean and maintainable way.

## Project Status

```
Completed as part of front-end development training
```

## Description

```
This project simulates a social network interface where users can create, edit, and manage image cards with titles. It was designed as a travel memory platform, allowing users to organize and display their favorite experiences. The focus is on responsive design, dynamic DOM manipulation, and clean component architecture.
```

## Features

```
-Responsive and clean user interface
-Semantic HTML structure
-Dynamic card creation and DOM manipulation
-Interactive UI with event-driven behavior
-Scalable and modular code structure
```

## Challenges and Solutions

```
-One of the main challenges was managing dynamic DOM updates when creating new cards. To solve this, I structured reusable functions and separated logic into components, improving scalability and readability.

-Another challenge was maintaining responsiveness across multiple breakpoints. This was addressed using modular CSS structure and consistent layout rules.
```

## Technologies Used

```
-HTML5: structure and semantic elements;
-CSS3: layout, styles, and responsive behavior;
-JavaScript (Vanilla JS): interactivity, DOM manipulation, and dynamic behavior;
```

## Skills Demonstrated

```
-Responsive web design using modern CSS techniques;
-DOM manipulation and dynamic content rendering;
-Event handling and interactive UI logic;
-Modular project organization (BEM methodology);
-Code structure focused on scalability and readability;
-Version control with Git and GitHub Pages deployment
```

## Project Architecture

```
-blocks: modular CSS files organized using BEM methodology;
-components: JavaScript modules responsible for UI logic and DOM behavior;
-pages: entry files (index.css and index.js);
-images: static assets used in the interface;
-vendor: third-party styles such as normalize.css and fonts;
```
